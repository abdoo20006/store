					<h2>Khan el khalili</h2>
					<p>
						The Khan el-Khalili market dates back centuries and has been
						 an important part of Cairo since its establishment in 1382
						  by Emir Djaharks el-Khalili. In addition to being a popular 
						  shopping destination, it was also used as a political gathering
						   place during the Mamluk period (1250–1517). Today, it’s
						    the largest souk in all of the Middle East
						, with over 4,000 shops spread across its winding alleys.
